# How to build

1. [Install flutter](https://flutter.dev)

2. Clone the repo:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://gitlab.com/famedly/fluffychat
cd fluffychat
```

3. Choose your target platform below and enable support for it.

4. Debug with: `flutter run`

### Android

* Install CMake from the SDK Manager

* Install ninja:
```
sudo apt install ninja-build
```

* Build with: `flutter build apk`

### iOS / iPadOS

* With xcode you can't build a release version without our cert. :-/ Use `flutter run --profile` to have a working version on your iOS device.

### Web

* Enable web support in Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web

* Optionally edit the file `lib/app_config.dart`. If you e.g. only want to change the default homeserver, then only modify the `defaultHomeserver` key.

* Build with:
```bash
./scripts/prepare-web.sh
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build web --release --verbose
```

* Optionally configure by serving a `config.json` at the same path as fluffychat.
  An example can be found at `config.sample.json`. None of these
  values have to exist, the ones stated here are the default ones. If you e.g. only want
  to change the default homeserver, then only modify the `default_homeserver` key.

### Desktop (Linux, Windows, macOS)

* Enable Desktop support in Flutter: https://flutter.dev/desktop

* Build with one of these:
```bash
flutter build linux --release
flutter build windows --release
flutter build macos --release
```


## How to add translations for your language

You can use Weblate to translate the app to your language:

https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fluffychat/



1. Replace the non-translated string in the codebase:
```
Text("Hello world"),
```
with a method call:
```
Text(L10n.of(context).helloWorld),
```

and add the following import if missing:

```
import 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/l10n.dart';
```

2. Add the string to `/lib/l10n/l10n_en.arb`:

(The following example need to be sorounded by the usual json `{}` and after the `@@locale` key)

Example A:
```
"helloWorld": "Hello World!",
"@helloWorld": {
  "description": "The conventional newborn programmer greeting"
}
```

Example B:
```
"hello": "Hello {userName}",
"@hello": {
  "description": "A message with a single parameter",
  "placeholders": {
    "userName": {
      "type": “String”,
      “example”: “Bob”
    }
  }
}
```

3. For testing just run a regular build without extras

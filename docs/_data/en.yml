    dreamText:
        Imagine a world where everyone can choose the messenger they like and is still able to chat with all of their friends.<br>
        A world where there are no companies spying on you when you send selfies to friends and lovers.<br>
        And a world where apps are made for fluffyness and not for profit. ♥
